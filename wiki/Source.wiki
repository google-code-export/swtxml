#summary Sources and developer setup

= Getting started with SWT/XML development =

SWT/XML sources are available on github: [http://github.com/ralfebert/swtxml/].
If you never used git before see [http://github.com/guides/home GitHub Guides] for documentation on installing/using git.

Check out the git repository using:
{{{
git clone git://github.com/ralfebert/swtxml.git
}}}

= Eclipse setup =

SWT/XML is developed and tested with Eclipse for RCP/Plug-in Developers 3.4 (Ganymede). You might run into incompatibilities with older versions.

The git repository contains three plugins:

  * *com.swtxml* (the runtime plug-in for your application)
  * *com.swtxml.ide* (the IDE plug-in for editing SWT/XML files using Eclipse Web Tools)
  * *easymock* (easymock is used for testing SWT/XML, so I bundled it with the SWT/XML plug-ins)

Import them using File / Import / Existing Projects into Workspace.

Start the IDE using "Launch an Eclipse application" from com.swtxml.ide's "plugin.xml".

There is a comprehensive test suite in {{{com.swtxml/test}}}. To execute the tests run {{{com.swtxml.AllTests}}} as *JUnit test*.
