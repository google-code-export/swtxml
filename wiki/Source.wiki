#summary Sources and developer setup

= Getting started with SWT/XML development =

SWT/XML is hosted on github: [http://github.com/ralfebert/swtxml/].
If you never used git before see [http://github.com/guides/home GitHub Guides] for documentation on installing/using git.

Check out the git repository using:
{{{
git clone git://github.com/ralfebert/swtxml.git
}}}

= Eclipse setup =

The git repository contains three plugins:

* com.swtxml (the runtime plug-in for your application)
* com.swtxml.ide (the IDE plug-in for editing SWT/XML files using Eclipse Web Tools)
* easymock (as easymock is heavily used for testing SWT/XML, I bundled it with the SWT/XML plug-ins)

Import them using File / Import / Existing Projects into Workspace. Currently I'm only developing and testing with Eclipse 3.4, so you might run into incompatibilities with older versions.

Start the IDE using "Launch an Eclipse application" from com.swtxml.ide's "plugin.xml".
